# Prerequisites
C++

python 3

# Usage
We provided two cases for MNE:
1. FB15K: [FreeBase][2]
2. WN18: [WordNet][3]

and there are six files/folders for each case:
- `MNE.cpp`: The MNE model for embedding
- `logistic-link-prediction.py`: Link prediction by the embedded network
- `logistic-triplet-classification.py`: Triplet classification by the embedded network
- `/data for embedding`: The dataset for embedding training
- `/data for link prediction`: The dataset for link prediction
- `/data for triplet classification`: The dataset for triplet classification

# Note
The output files will be stored in `./result ` directory during embedding training.
